1. For the first case study, the model giving the perfect extrapolation is provided in the pth file in the Pytorch model folder
2. The file network.py is needed to run the notebook L4_CS2_PINN
3. The pth file is the Pytorch model with excellent extrapolation performance as shown in the lecture slides
