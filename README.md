# AI-in-Bio-Chemical-Engineering-Lecture-Coding

Welcome to the Lecture Examples repository! This repository contains Python code files used as examples during my lectures. Each lecture is organized into a separate folder for easy navigation and reference.

## Table of Contents

1. [Lecture 1: Machine learning overview and classical regression](/Lecture_1/)
2. [Lecture 2: Neural networks for regression and classification](/lecture_2/)
3. [Lecture 3: Unsupervised Learning](/lecture_3/)
4. [Lecture 4: Hybrid models and physics-Informed neural networks](/lecture_4/)
5. [Lecture 5: Computer vision](/lecture_5/)
6. [Lecture 6: Molecular property prediction with graph neural networks](/lecture_6/)
7. [Lecture 7: ChatGPT and ethical aspects in AI](/lecture_7/)

## Folder Structure

Each lecture is organized into a separate folder with a meaningful name to help you quickly find the relevant code examples. Inside each folder, you'll find Python code files (.py) and any additional resources or documentation related to the lecture.

   ```
lecture_1/
├── example1.py
├── example2.py
├── ...
├── README.md (Optional: Additional information about Lecture 1)
```

You can also run the code online via [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or  Google's [Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/). Binder is a free, open-source web service that packages Jupyter notebooks inside an executable container, which can be run within a web browser, no installation required. 
Colab allows users with Google accounts to execute Jupyter notebooks on the Google cloud.
