- Lecture 6 examples: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/process-intelligence-research/AI-in-Bio-Chemical-Engineering-Lecture-Coding/blob/main/Lecture%206/Lecture6_example.ipynb)

## Folder Structure

Each lecture is organized into a separate folder with a meaningful name to help you quickly find the relevant code examples. Inside each folder, you'll find Python code files (.ipynb) and any additional resources or documentation related to the lecture.

   ```
lecture_1/
├── Lecture1.example.py
├── ...
├── README.md (Optional: Additional information about Lecture 1)
```

## Run code online

You can also run the code online via Google's [Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/). 
Colab allows users with Google accounts to execute Jupyter notebooks on the Google cloud. 

**To execute the notebook in Colab:**
1. Click the `Open in Colab` button above. It will launch the notebook directly.
2. Make the notebook live by clicking 'Connect' in the Colab toolbar. 
3. Select `Runtime > Run All` in the menu to execute the notebook. (You may get a warning that the page was not authored by Google.) 

## Getting Started and run code locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lecture-examples.git


2. Navigate to the specific lecture folder you are interested in.

3. Explore the Python code files provided as examples during the lecture.
